Jungle King is a turn-based two-player board game (9x7 grid). On each side of the board are the home bases surrounded by traps and there are two small lakes in the middle of the board.

THE GAME:
The game starts with animal pieces faced down and shuffled as each player has to choose one of the eight pieces, the stronger the piece meaning that player will go first.
To end the game is when an animal piece lands on the opposite player's home base.

A player can MOVE by inputting (W, A, S, D).
Each player has 8 animal pieces, each animal has their INTEGER strength (High -> Low):
  - Elephant
  - Lion (can cross the lake)
  - Tiger (can cross the lake)
  - Leopard
  - Wolf
  - Dog
  - Cat
  - Rat (can swim one space at a time)

TRAPS can make the animal in place WEAK, meaning ANY piece near it can CAPTURE the trapped animal. The animal trapped can REGAIN stregnth when they leave the trap.


MORE DETAILS ON THE ANIMAL PIECES:
The animals cannot cross the lake if a RAT were to be blocking it, and naturally stronger animals can CAPTURE weaker animals and they are REMOVED from the board, but only a RAT can capture 
the ELEPHANT as it can sneak.
